The ontology server acts as a central repository for information gleaned
from parsing the abstracts. It consists of a relational network with
directional links between the elements.<p>
An element in this case consists of any word from the abstracts. Noun phrases,
verbs, adjective phrases, etc. are all represented as 'concepts' in the
network.<p>
The ontology interface is command-line via a port on the hosting server.
Commands are entered in a simple, generic sql-like syntax. Commands are
summarized at the end of this section.<p>
Each concept in the network can have any number of input and output links
to other concepts. These links take the form of a list of input-output
pairs. Any specific link may have any number of inputs or outputs. Inputs
are connected by boolean and. Thus, a link's output is only asserted if
all inputs are not known to be false (which means they could be ambiguous
or true).<p>
Each concept has a list of these input-output pair links, with which relations
and implications can be determined. The links are initially established by
corresponding relations in the abstracts.<p>
Relations among the elements of the network are established by setting flags
on the elements and performing a kind of BFS to find any intersection points.
For example, if we had the relation "protein X causes low pH." and elsewhere,
the relation "low pH causes cancer" (obviously completely manufactured), and
we wanted to know the relation between protein X and cancer, we would first
flag "protein X" and "cancer". After determining that there were no elements
in the network possessing flags from both sides, we would expand each side's
flags to the concepts directly connected to each of them, respectively.
Continuing in this manner, there would eventually be a flag at "low pH",
and we can report this as the query describes.<p>
We attempt to create deeper associations by generalizing word meanings to some
extent. We use wordnet to determine if two words are close enough to be
considered synonyms, in which case they both exist as a single concept in
the network. Using this, it is more likely to get some generalizations, but
at the expense of not taking the time to examine other possible connections.
This simplification has been used elsewhere [<a href="#1">1</a>] with some success.<p>
